### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer whose most interests are related to software development and automating data processing (ETL tools) using JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js RE, Python, AWS services, and more.

In my spare time, I implement some scripts/tools based on Telegram API and other things just for fun. Also, I enjoy hiking and playing video games (I like colony simulators like RimWorld or Space Haven).
