### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vladimir, a Full Stack Engineer with a passion for software development and automating data processes. My expertise lies in JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, Python, and some AWS services. At the moment, I specialize in building and maintaining web applications using frameworks like Angular, NestJS, and Express.js. More information about my skills and experience you can find in my [Curriculum Vitae]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cv.md %}).

In my spare time, I delve into Web Services Integration using tools like IFTTT and Node-RED, exploring the capabilities of Cloudflare Workers and KV for efficient serverless solutions, bot development for Telegram platform and other things that are related to automation stuff just for fun. When I'm not immersed in the tech world, I enjoy hiking and playing video games, particularly colony simulators like RimWorld and Space Haven.
